Be as specific as you can.\nI am here because I want to learn how to become a hero and better use my quirk for good. I want to make some actual friends I am close to and overcome by social ineptness. I have been sheltered by my father almost my entire life and my mother can't do much because she is busy a lot. I think it's about time that I break through and enter the world and do what I want to do in life.\n\n#2 - What do you hope to become in life?\nI hope to become a hero that people look up to. I wish to be both entertaining to watch and useful for saving the lives of others. I also want to make my mother proud and prove to my father that being a hero is ultimately a good thing.\n\n#3 - What traits make a good hero, and how do you embody those traits, or fail to?\nA good hero is respectful and good hearted. They should be careful and wise and always put others first. They should always do there best and should be optimistic whenever possible. I am also careful and I try to be respectful. Although I'm not always optimistic.", "author": {"id": 130922, "sheet": 231780, "name_then": "T\u014deiki Horoya"}, "whispered_to": [130922], "created": "2020-10-03T18:45:27.561950Z"},{"id": 10846506, "content": "#1: I am here today because I would like to become a U.A. student.

I may not be the smartest, bravest, or strongest contender, but I have drive and I'll never quit. When I was little, I didn't have people who would stand up for me. But when I was nine and I watched All Might and the others from UA fight against All For One, I knew that a true hero doesn't quit. They stand up for those who cannot protect themselves. It wasn't just All Might fighting against All For One, but all the other heroes who risked their lives to protect those in danger. I've tried ever since then to be that for those around me. I think UA is the place that can help me to hone my quirk and use it in ways to help those who are in need.*\n\n**#2 - What do you hope to become in life?**\n\n*I hope to become a hero. I want to become a hero that people know they can depend on to be there when they need me. I want to be a comfort to those who find themselves discouraged. So that when they see me standing up, they'll know they can stand up too. I want to become someone who can encourage my fellow heroes and bolster those coming up behind me to do their best and live up to their potential.*\n\n*Aside from that, I hope to become a teacher and a mother one day. I don't know to what capacity that will be. I may not be a formal teacher in a school. But I know that I will pass on whatever knowledge and whatever love I've acquired on to those who come after me. Our world is sometimes a broken world, but it is also so full of potential. I want to be a part of helping to see us strive for that, both on a global scale and an individual one.*\n\n**#3 - What traits make a good hero, and how do you embody those traits, or fail to?**\n\n*What makes a good hero? I think that a good hero is someone who never gives up and gives their all. Every person has their limits. We aren't all meant to fight on the front lines. But everyone has something they can give and something they can excel at. I think a good hero gives their utmost, despite the odds. They learn when to push forward and when to rely on their companions. And above all they seek to protect and to let the world know that we will be there.*\n\n*I am not all of those things yet. I have a long way to go. But I won't give up. I will always give my all in order to reach my goals. Whether I end up at UA or another school, I will still press on so that I can become the hero that I believe I can be. If I can make even one person's day better, even for just one single day, it will be worth it.*", "author": {"id": 153575, "sheet": 266388, "name_then": "Reina Tsumizu"}, "created": "2021-02-02T07:39:25.567386Z", "is_description": true},{"id": 12193391, "content": "Reina looks back over her answers, hoping they'll be adequate enough for what the proctors expect.
