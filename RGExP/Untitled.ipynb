One is your standard Castle, a massive stone fortress on a cliff giving it a view of both the ocean and the city it protects. The other is a somewhat less massive domed building that seems to be the city's center piece.\n",

There's the standard fire remnants of course, but one building looks waterlogged and it's neighbors are untouched. Further on a building's pieces hover in an arcane field and several mages are arguing over how to fix it.\n",

Your travel expenses will be compensated and you have rooms for the night of course, so please enjoy our city. Any companies lower in number, I hope you can make friends.\n",
